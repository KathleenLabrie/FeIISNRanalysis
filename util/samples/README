This directory contains sample of files that are produced 
by the software as part of the simulation process.  There 
are included here simply as reference if I get confused again.

README_cube: This is the master file for a complete simulation.
	It is used only to keep track of the cubes and the status
	of the simulations.  The initial version is generated by
	"?????"  (mkcube.py maybe? since I want to have mkcube
	set up everything, not just create empty cube directories.)

donightqueue.sh:  This is the script used to queue simulations at night.
	It is generated by mknightqueue.sh.

doqueue.sh:  This is the script used to queue simulations during
	the day when they can be monitored.  This is the crudest queueing.
	It doesn't check for load and will launch the models defined in
	dofit.sh.  It is generated by mkqueue.sh

dowkendqueue.sh:  This is the script used to queue simulations over the
	weekend. It will check the load.  This is useful for example when
	the simulations are fun on someone elses computer.  If they come
	in to work, the simulation should stop and not hog the CPU.
	It is generated by mkwkendqueue.sh.

fitn1569best.dat: Output from snrpopfit, realization 1.  Other than that,
        I don't remember what it represents.

fitn1569bestap.dat: Output from snrpopfit, realization 1.  Other than that,
        I don't remember what it represents.

        I don't remember what it represents.
